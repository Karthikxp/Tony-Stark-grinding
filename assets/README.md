# Animation Assets

Place your two pixel art PNG files here:

- `frame1.png` - First frame of your Iron Man anvil animation (e.g., hammer raised)
- `frame2.png` - Second frame of your Iron Man anvil animation (e.g., hammer down)

## Image Requirements:
- Format: PNG with transparency support
- **Optimal size: 22x22 pixels** (native macOS menu bar size - no resizing needed!)
- Alternative sizes: 16x16 or 44x44 pixels (will be scaled to 22x22)
- Keep the pixel art style for that retro look
- Make sure both frames have the same dimensions for smooth animation

## Tips:
- The app will automatically cycle between these two frames
- You can adjust animation speed through the context menu
- If the images aren't found, the app will show colored squares as fallbacks for testing
